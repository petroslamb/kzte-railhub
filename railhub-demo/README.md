# RailHub Demo

This directory contains a manually scaffolded Next.js 14 application that
mirrors the output of `create-next-app`. Network access is restricted in the
challenge environment, so the template and dependencies were defined manually.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The project already includes the Solana wallet adapter dependencies needed for
future RailHub integration work.
